# GSS2018_Cosmology

This is the repository for Group 1, covering the topic of *Dark Matter in Cosmology*. See the main repository - [GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018](https://github.com/bradkav/GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018) - for more information.

In particular, for information about the scripts, [see here](https://github.com/bradkav/GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018/wiki/Scripts).

Use the `review/` folder for the LaTeX files for your review and the `scripts/` folder for your code.

-----------------

### Plan for the review

* Add a section on possible particle physics solutions to the 'Cracks in LCDM' (self-interacting DM, fuzzy DM, warm DM, etc.) - what simulations have been done and how do they solve these problems? [**BJK 19/06/2018**]

### General comments/feedback

* Make sure to distinguish between the CMB and BAO (the latter is typically discussed as a feature observed in large scale clustering of galaxies). Note of course the common origin of the CMB and BAO.

# GSS2018_Cosmology

This is the repository for Group 1, covering the topic of *Dark Matter in Cosmology*. See the main repository - [GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018](https://github.com/bradkav/GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018) - for more information.

In particular, for information about the scripts, [see here](https://github.com/bradkav/GRAPPA_Student_Seminar_2018/wiki/Scripts).

Use the `review/` folder for the LaTeX files for your review and the `scripts/` folder for your code.

-----------------

### Plan for the review

* Add a section on possible particle physics solutions to the 'Cracks in LCDM' (self-interacting DM, fuzzy DM, warm DM, etc.) - what simulations have been done and how do they solve these problems? [**BJK 19/06/2018**]
* Add a (short) section discussing discrepancies between local estimates (from measurements of Type 1a Supernovae) and global estimates (from cosmology, e.g. the CMB) of the Hubble parameter H0


### General comments/feedback

* Can add a short discussion of inflation, but nothing too detailed. The discussion should be more focused on 'setting the stage' for the CMB (that inflation gives us the initial fluctuations which seed the structure of the universe). 
* Make sure to distinguish between the CMB and BAO (the latter is typically discussed as a feature observed in large scale clustering of galaxies). Note of course the common origin of the CMB and BAO.
* Improve the discussion of simulations. Make clear the physical distinction between different simulation techniques. How does SPH differ from AMR? Which other codes are used? E.g. "moving mesh" techniques? What is the state of the art? How is "sub-grid" physics included? What are the uncertainties in these "sub-grid" physics models which account for feedback?
